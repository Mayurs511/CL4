
Step 1: Connect to Your Data Source 
The first step in creating your Sales Dashboard using Power BI is to connect to your data 
source. For this project, we will utilize a sales dataset from a USA-based superstore for the 
year 2015. You can also download this dataset from here. This dataset contains 
comprehensive sales information, including product details, categories, customer 
segments, regions, order dates, sales, profits, etc. Establishing this data connection is the 
foundation upon which we will build insightful visualizations and metrics to showcase 
sales performance and trends. 
To connect to a data store using Power BI - 
Open Power BI Desktop. 
Click "Home" > "Get Data" > select your data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, database). 
Browse and select your dataset, then follow the prompts to configure the connection and 
load data into Power BI. 
 



Step 2: Create A New Report 
The next step in our journey to build a Sales Dashboard using Power BI is to create a new 
report canvas. After loading your data, click on the "Report View" tab (located on the left 
side) in Power BI Desktop. This will open a blank canvas where you can start designing 
your dashboard. Here, you'll add various visualizations, charts, and KPIs to represent your 
sales data effectively. This canvas serves as a dynamic workspace to arrange and customize 
elements that will form the basis of your interactive sales dashboard. 




Step 3: Add Visualizations 
In this pivotal step of our Sales Dashboard creation process, we'll add a wide range of 
visualizations to convey vital insights from our data. To create these visualizations in 
Power BI â€“ 
Drag and drop the required fields onto the visualization area. 
Choose the appropriate visualization type (bar, line, or pie chart). 
Customize the visualizations by configuring labels, colors, and other settings. 

In this project, we will focus on below visualizations - 
To visualize sales and profit trends over time, we'll add a combination bar and line chart. 
The bars will represent monthly sales, while the line will represent profit. This dual-axis 
visualization will provide a clear depiction of how sales and profit correlate month by 
month, enabling us to spot trends and patterns. 
For a comprehensive understanding of our sales distribution, we'll employ pie charts. These 
charts will depict the proportion of sales across various segments, including regions, 
customer segments, and shipping modes. 



Step 4: Add the KPIs to the Dashboard 
To add Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to the dashboard, we'll utilize card 
visualizations in Power BI - 
Click on "Card" from the Visualizations pane. 
Drag and drop the relevant field onto the "Values" section of the card. 
Customize the card by adding appropriate titles and formatting. 
For instance, you can create KPI cards to display metrics like Total Revenue, Average 
Order Value, and Year-over-Year Growth. These concise visual elements provide 
immediate insights into essential performance indicators, enhancing the dashboard's 
impact and usability. In this project, we will add two KPIs, total sales and average sales 
per order, in the dashboard. 



Step 5: Add Filters and Interactivity 
Adding filters and interactivity to the sales dashboard is crucial as it empowers users to 
explore the data, focus on specific aspects, and gain deeper insights. Filters allow users to 
dynamically adjust data views, making the dashboard adaptable to various scenarios. 
Here's how to achieve it in Power BI - 
From the "Visualizations" pane, select "Slicer." 
Drag fields relevant to filtering (e.g., region, order date) onto the slicer. 
Users can now interactively filter data by selecting options within the slicer. 
This feature enables users to dynamically refine the displayed data dynamically, gaining 
deeper insights and customizing their analysis according to specific criteria. In this 
dashboard, we will add a filter based on the region feature. We have also added a title bar 
in the canvas, as shown below.
