1. Setting Up MongoDB
To get started, you need to install MongoDB on your machine or use a cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas). You also need to have the PyMongo library to interact with MongoDB using Python.

To install PyMongo:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pymongo
2. Connecting to MongoDB
You can connect to a local MongoDB server or a remote server.

python
Copy
Edit
import pymongo

# Connect to local MongoDB server
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")

# Create or use an existing database
db = client["student_database"]
In this case, we're connecting to a MongoDB instance running locally and creating a database called student_database.

3. Create (Insert) Operation
In MongoDB, documents are inserted into collections. If the collection does not exist, MongoDB will create it automatically.

python
Copy
Edit
# Access the collection (it will be created automatically if not present)
students_collection = db["students"]

# Create a new document (record) to insert
student = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 21,
    "course": "Computer Science",
    "grades": [85, 90, 92]
}

# Insert the document into the collection
students_collection.insert_one(student)
4. Read Operation
You can read documents using various queries. You can retrieve all documents, or query specific ones based on certain criteria.

Read All Documents:
python
Copy
Edit
# Retrieve all students
students = students_collection.find()

# Print each student's information
for student in students:
    print(student)
Read One Document (with condition):
python
Copy
Edit
# Find a student by name
student = students_collection.find_one({"name": "John Doe"})
print(student)
5. Update Operation
You can update documents in a collection using the update_one() or update_many() methods.

Update One Document:
python
Copy
Edit
# Update a student's grade list by name
students_collection.update_one(
    {"name": "John Doe"},  # Filter
    {"$set": {"grades": [88, 91, 94]}}  # Update operation
)
Update Many Documents:
python
Copy
Edit
# Update multiple students who are in 'Computer Science' course
students_collection.update_many(
    {"course": "Computer Science"},  # Filter
    {"$set": {"course": "Data Science"}}  # Update operation
)
6. Delete Operation
You can delete documents using delete_one() or delete_many().

Delete One Document:
python
Copy
Edit
# Delete a student by name
students_collection.delete_one({"name": "John Doe"})
Delete Many Documents:
python
Copy
Edit
# Delete all students from a certain course
students_collection.delete_many({"course": "Data Science"})
7. Database and Collection Operations
You can also perform operations like listing all databases, collections, and dropping a database or collection.

python
Copy
Edit
# List all databases
print(client.list_database_names())

# List all collections in the database
print(db.list_collection_names())

# Drop a collection
students_collection.drop()

# Drop a database
client.drop_database("student_database")
8. Example Workflow
Below is an example workflow combining all CRUD operations.

python
Copy
Edit
import pymongo

# Connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["student_database"]
students_collection = db["students"]

# 1. Insert data
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 22, "course": "Biology", "grades": [88, 91, 89]}
students_collection.insert_one(student)

# 2. Read data
student = students_collection.find_one({"name": "Alice"})
print("Before Update:", student)

# 3. Update data
students_collection.update_one(
    {"name": "Alice"},
    {"$set": {"grades": [90, 92, 94]}}
)

# 4. Read updated data
student = students_collection.find_one({"name": "Alice"})
print("After Update:", student)

# 5. Delete data
students_collection.delete_one({"name": "Alice"})
9. Conclusion
MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage data. With its MapReduce-like functionality and the ability to perform CRUD operations, it's a great choice for modern, dynamic applications that require a document-oriented database model.

Would you like help with any part of this, or perhaps more complex examples (e.g., aggregation queries or performance optimization)?
